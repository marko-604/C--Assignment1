WINTER 2025 COMP345 Project


TEAM: The Scientists

Tower defense game works by creating waves of critters, the player creates towers by hovering over the tiles of the game and pressing keys to create the corresponding towers:

T: regular tower
F: freezing tower
S: sniper tower
B: bomb tower


Pressing the L key over a tower will level up the level. Pressing the X key will sell the tower.

The game begins by asking the user for the grid dimensions in the terminal then the map editor appears the user can create the path and place the ENTRY(E key) and EXIT(X key) to toggle between path and empty tiles simply click the tiles.
